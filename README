servload
========

servload originated as part of salbnet, a load balancing framework. servload can
measure performance of services. Therefore servload uses requests and responses 
to determine performance metrics. servload loads and maybe modifies a given log
file and issues the resulting requests.

See INSTALL file for installation notes.
