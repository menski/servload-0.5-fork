servload
========

servload originated as part of salbnet, a load balancing framework. servload can
measure performance of services. Therefore servload uses requests and responses 
to determine performance metrics. servload loads and maybe modifies a given log
file and issues the resulting requests.

See INSTALL file for installation notes.

Methods to modify the log:
    fast
        - replay log as fast as possible (e.g. ignore timestamps)
        - limiting factor is the allowed number of open file descriptors
          (see ulimit -n)

    multiply [factor]
        - multiply every request by factor given as argument
        - factor: unsigned integer > 1

    peak [factor]
        - multiply every request by factor given as argument, iff the number of
          requests with the same timestamp is greater or equal the median number
          of request per second
        - factor: unsigned integer > 1

    score [factor]
        - assigns every session a score value from 0 to 25 for each of the
          following session characteristics: session length, session duration,
          median thinktime, median transfered bytes
        - to normalize the session characteristics the average absolute deviation
          from median is calculated (see [1])
        - if the value of a characteristic is greater than the average absolute
          deviation the session obtains a score relative to the maximum value
          of this characteristic
        - the maximum score for a session is 100
        - every session which achives a score greater than 50 is multiplied by
          the given factor
        - factor: unsigned integer > 1
