servload
========

servload originated as part of salbnet, a load balancing framework. servload can
measure performance of services. Therefore servload uses requests and responses 
to determine performance metrics. servload loads and maybe modifies a given log
file and issues the resulting requests.

See INSTALL file for installation notes.

Methods
-------

The following methods are available to modify logs:

fast
        Replay logs as fast as possible (e.g. ignore timestamps). Limiting
        factor is the allowed number of open file descriptors (see ulimit -n).

multiply [factor]
        Multiply every request by factor given as argument.

peak [factor]
        Multiply every request by factor given as argument, if the number of
        requests with the same timestamp is greater or equal the median number
        of request per second.

score [factor]
        Assigns every session a score value from 0 to 25 for each of the 
        following session characteristics: session length, session duration,
        median thinktime and median transfered bytes. Session characteristics 
        are normalized through the calculation of the average absolute deviation
        from median [1]. If the value of a characteristic is greater than
        the average absolute deviation the session obtains a score relative to
        the maximum value of this characteristic. The maximum score for a
        session is 100 and every session which achives a score greater than 50
        is multiplied by the given factor.

For multiply peak and score factor is and unsigned integer greater than one.
